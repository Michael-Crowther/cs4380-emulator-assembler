Project 1 Emulator - Mark 1 of the 4380

This emulator accepts up to two command line arguments for reading in a binary file with an optional memory size. It then enters an execution loop to fetch, decode, and execute valid instructions specified by the ISA. I've written tests for these functions, which can be found in the src folder, and run with ./runTests after compiling Cmake and make.
